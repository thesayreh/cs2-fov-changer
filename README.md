üìå cs2-fov-changer
Description
cs2-fov-changer is a lightweight C++ tool that modifies the Field of View (FOV) value in Counter-Strike 2 by accessing and writing to the game's process memory. It demonstrates fundamental memory manipulation techniques using the Windows API.

üîß Features
Locates the running Counter-Strike 2 window using its title.

Retrieves the process ID and opens it with full access rights.

Scans the process's loaded modules to find the base address of client.dll.

Reads a known offset (0x1A459E0) to obtain a pointer to the player data structure.

Writes a new FOV value (120) to the correct memory address at offset +0x6F4.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
WinAPI: FindWindow, GetWindowThreadProcessId, OpenProcess, ReadProcessMemory, WriteProcessMemory

Module scanning: CreateToolhelp32Snapshot, Module32First, Module32Next

Low-level memory manipulation and reverse-engineering concepts
